##### The Journey Begins

**Today's Progress**: I'm still a newbie learning to code so I'm going through CodeCamp projects. I'm working on one of thew first assignments which is to create a tribute page for someone. The User stories are simple. Include an image, some text and a Link to more informaiton about that person. It's all to be done in codepen.io.

I chose to do my tribute page for Valentina Tereshkova who was a Russian Cosmonaut an first female in space.

**Thoughts:** I fell into some traps and focused too much of my time on trying to find a cool background image or video for the page and ended up using [Saransh Sinha's Parralax Star Background](https://codepen.io/saransh/details/BKJun#forks). It's a really cool effect but it was probably a mistake, since it is written in HAML and SASS, neither of which I know anything about. It's been fun figuring it out though and I've made some changes here and there but I really should have just compliled the code and worked in HTML and CSS which I understand a bit better. Alas!

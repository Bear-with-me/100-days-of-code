# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 3rd, 2017
##### The Journey Begins

**Today's Progress:** I'm still new to coding so I have been going through freeCodeCamp. I'm working on one of the first assignments which is to create a tribute page for someone. The User stories are simple. Include an image, some text and a Link to more information about that person. It is all to be done in codepen.io.

I chose to do my tribute page for Valentina Tereshkova who was a Russian Cosmonaut and first female in space.

**Thoughts:** I fell into some traps and focused too much of my time on trying to find a cool background image or video for the page and ended up using [Saransh Sinha's Parralax Star Background](https://codepen.io/saransh/details/BKJun#forks). It's a really cool CSS animation but it was probably a mistake to us it as it is written in HAML and SASS, neither of which I know anything about. It's been fun figuring it out though and I have been able to add some text and an image but I really should have just compliled the code and worked in HTML and CSS which I understand a bit better. Alas!

### Day 1: June 4th, 2017
##### Breaking Orbit

**Today's Progress:** I managed to get the tribute page to a place I was happy with it while still fullfilling the user story. I would consider this project complete. It's time to move on to the next challenge.

**Thoughts:** I really should have worked in the compiled HTML and CSS. I ran into all kinds of trouble working in HAML and SASS and I think it was purely because I have 0 experience with either. For instance, I wasn't able to get my 'a' tag to open in a new tab as I couldn't figure out how to get target: _blank into the code. I also ran into trouble trying to get font awesome into the project, they just wouldn't render.

I wanted to add a bit more interaction to the page by having the wiki link and the flight details hidden when you first load into the page. A user would be able to show & hide them by selecting a down arrow on screen but I didn't have the time last night to fiddle with the JQuery. I might come back to it later but for now this project is complete.
